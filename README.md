## Sia Assist - Personal Airport Assistant

## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In this project, we designed an intelligent chatbot called ‘SIA Assist’, that
can be primarily used to obtain information on all aspects of Singapore’s Changi Airport.

Our proposed chatbot shows true effectiveness when the system has access to user’s travel
information so that his responses can be personalised - either by integrating the chatbot with
an airline application or obtaining his travel information in some other form.
